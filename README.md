# SimPendel
Control System and Simulation of an Inverted Pendulum!

## Aim
This project aims to accomplish the following:
1. Accurately simulate a pendulum using the necessary Physics
2. Design and implement controllers (PID/State-Space) that are able to keep the pendulum at a target angle
3. Animate the movement of the pendulum in a Matlab Figure

## Usage
Simply run the *'Main.m'* file and follow the interactive menus!
